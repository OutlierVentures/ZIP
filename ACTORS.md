## Value Exchange Map

Only developers and investors interact directly with the CStack. Value exchanges:

1. Money in from developers.
2. Money in from and out to investors.

Enterprises interact indirectly with the CStack through developers. Value exchange:

1. Money in to developers from enterprises.

Consumers interact (doubly) indirectly with the CStack through enterprises. Value exchange:

1. Money in to enterprises from consumers.

To motivate these actors to use the CStack:

1. The CStack needs to act as a speculative instrument for investors.
2. The CStack needs to provide convenience to developers.
3. Developers need to fulfill enterprise demand, cost-saving or revenue generation.
4. Enterprises need to provide convenience to consumers.

The CStack should make it easy for:

1. Investors to speculate on the (units of work of the) CStack.
2. Developers to buy units of work on the CStack.
3. Developers to create cost-saving or revenue generation opportunities for enterprises.
4. Enterprises to make money from consumers by meeting demand.
